# Bluesky App Passwords

App passwords are codes that Bluesky generates for you which you can use for third-party apps, such as Beeskie. It is **not** that same as your Bluesky account password.

### How to generate an App Password

1. Login to your account on the official website https://bsky.app.
1. Open settings from the left sidebar menu.
1. Click "Privacy and security".
1. Click "App passwords".
1. Click "Add App Password".

Bluesky will generate a new code and display it on screen. Copy that code and paste it into Beeskie in the app password field.
